Hello, everyone! I'm excited to introduce you to my brand-new GitHub page. As I embark on this digital journey, my goal is to share my experiences, insights, and the valuable lessons I've gathered over the years.

One observation I've made is that for impactful automation, developers need more than just well-written user stories. Often, automation projects focus purely on tech. But without grasping the underlying business processes, even the slickest solutions can miss the mark.

For any tech solution, especially automation, to truly shine, it's paramount to first optimize the process. Only then, automation can work its magic. As I often put it: "Before coding the solution, decode the process." Stay with me for more reflections and real-world case studies on the synergy of business and tech!
