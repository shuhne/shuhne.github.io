Greetings! I'm Sascha, a developer who believes that to truly revolutionize industries, one must meld the intricacies of business logic with the elegance of code. My journey into Process Automation commenced during my days as a working student, tasked with creating individual RPA bots. It was during this phase in Berlin, amidst the cacophony of innovation, that I had an epiphany: while there was a growing demand for UI Automation via RPA, especially for integrating legacy systems, many simply wanted to automate existing, sub-optimal processes.

Such an approach was anathema to me. I quickly realized that for genuine, transformative process automation, it isn't sufficient to just code. It's imperative for FullStack developers to critically assess the requirements presented to them, delving deep into the underlying business processes. Rather than blindly automating flawed processes, the need of the hour is to propose solutions that are tailored to optimize these processes. After all, in this era, the lifeblood of any organization is its processesâ€”they need to be lean, efficient, and highly automated.

This ethos has been the cornerstone of my career. I have steered projects of varying magnitudes, consulted businesses on refining their processes, and even led teams of developers in creating cutting-edge solutions. But at the heart of it all lies my unwavering belief: real innovation arises only when one understands not just the 'how' but the profound 'why' behind it.

Thus, I offer a rare fusion of skills: the strategic acumen of a consultant and the technical prowess of a FullStack developer. Join me in redefining what it means to truly automate, optimize, and innovate.
